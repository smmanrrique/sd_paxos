# Distributed systems Reliability, Causation and Group Delivery

The finality of this project is to achieve the objectives of practice number one in subject Net and Distributed System at Zaragoza University.

## The project structure is:

```
reports     -->   This folder contains project specification and requirements.
  src         -->   This folder contains all code about the project.
        chandylamport       -->   
        communication       -->   
        config  functions   -->  
        logs                -->   
        main.go             -->   
        multicast           -->   
        test                -->   
        vclock              -->   
  .gitignore  -->   File indicate files or folder to ignore
  readme.md   -->   Describe all require information you let to know about the project
```

## The objectives of the project are learn and understand:

* How events hold communication in distributed systems.
* Ventages and disadvantages that protocols like tcp and udp in distributed application.
* Synchronization and recovery  protocols in distributed systems.
* When to use ventages of multicast  communication.

# Installation

This project requires:

```
go (>= 1.13)
```

Other library used:

* [vclock]()
* [go-multicast]()

# Source code

You can check the latest sources with the command:

> git clone https://github.com/smmanrrique/sd_paxos.git

**It's very important set correct path to run project or clone repository in folder "/home/userName/go/src/"**

# Copiar ssh a remote

> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa smmanrrique@localhost

# Execute main using one o this mode [TCP,UDP, CHANDY]

For execute main go program yo must use follow flag:

* name  --> Insert name like machine# (# is a number 1-3)
* mode  --> Mode to execute [tcp, udp, chandy] | default tcp
* log   --> With true Send output to log file otherwise print on terminal | default false

You need to open one terminal by every machine and execute go script in this order.

## machina3

>~/go/src/sd_paxos/src && go run main.go -name "machine3" -mode "chandy" -log true

## machina2

>~/go/src/sd_paxos/src && go run main.go -name "machine2"  -mode "chandy" -log true

## machina1

>~/go/src/sd_paxos/src && go run main.go -name "machine1" -mode "chandy" -log true


# Execute Test
For execute test you need to write right values in follow variables in config/go.ini:

```
  environment = development | production
  log = false | true
  mode = udp | tcp | chandy
```
>~/go/src/sd_paxos/src/test && go test -v -run TestCommunication
